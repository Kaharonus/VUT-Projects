# VUT Projects

All the projects that I got assigned at VUT/BUT (Vysoké učení technické v Brně/Brno university of technology) that had something to do with programming. 

They are in no particular order. The folders the projects are in were the courses where I got them assigned.

- IZP - "Introduction to Programming Systems"
- IOS - "Operating Systems"
- IJC - "The C Programming Language"
- ISJ - "Scripting Languages"
- INC - "Digital Systems Design"
